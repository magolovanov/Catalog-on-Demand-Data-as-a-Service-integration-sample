UI and source code that illustrate how a simple integration of Catalog-on-Demand® with Data-as-a-Service providers might work.

# Synopsis

UI and source code that illustrates how a simple integration of Catalog-on-Demand® with Data-as-a-Service providers might work. The workflow is as follows:

1. User goes to the application deployed on a Web site and is prompted for a Catalog-on-Demand user ID and password, and clicks "Login". 

2. The application makes ValidateUser Catalog-on-Demand API call, authorizes the user and obtains user attributes.

3. If ValidateUser is successful, the user is prompted to select from a list of authorized publication configurations (design specifications), and clicks Next.

4. User is prompted to upload a file that is a list of SKU numbers, and clicks Next.

5. The sample Web application calls a stub process with the list of SKUs. The sample stub process (https://webservices.catalog-on-demand.com/dataAsAServiceDemoStub/processSKUs.php) returns sample data file content.

6. User is prompted for a job ID and clicks Submit.

7. The sample Web application constructs Flexible Job File text that uses the job ID, configuration, and product data from the stub. The publication title and header are hard coded in this sample.

8. The application calls Flexible Job File API and submits the publication job. 

9. The application polls Catalog-on-Demand API (GetBackgroundJobProcessingState call) every 5 seconds until the job is complete. 

10. The application displays the URL to download the completed publication.

# Installation

Place dataAsAServiceDemo as a subdirectory of any Web server HTTP document root directory. The Web server must have PHP runtime (any more or less fresh version) installed. In the Web browser, navigate to the application: 

https://webservices.catalog-on-demand.com/dataAsAServiceDemo/index.php

(in this case, repository files have been deployed in the directory

/dataAsAServiceDemo)

# Sample application components

## UI screens

login.php: UI for the step 2 in the workflow. Calls processLogin.php and processes its output.

selectConfiguration.php: UI for the steps 4,5 in the workflow. Calls processConfiguration.php and processes its output.

submit.php: UI for the steps 4,5 in the workflow. Calls processSKUs.php and processes its output.

uploadSKUs.php: UI for the steps 6,7,8 in the workflow. Calls processSubmit.php and processes its output.

track.php: UI for the steps 9,10 in the workflow. Calls processTrack.php and processes its output.

## Server-side scripts

processLogin.php: makes ValidateUser Catalog-on-Demand API call with user credentials passed to it by login,php; in case of success, remembers user data in the session. Returns call status / error description to the caller.

processLogin.php: makes ValidateUser Catalog-on-Demand API call with user credentials passed to it by login,php; in case of success, remembers user data in the session. Returns call status / error description to the caller.

processConfiguration.php: remembers passed selected configuration index in the session. Returns call status to the caller.

processSKUs.php: processes SKU numbers file upload, calls the sample stub (data provider API imitation), receives the resulting data file text and remembers it in the session. Returns call status / error description to the caller.

processSubmit.php: remembers passed job ID, builds Flexible Job File text, makes Flexible Job File API call, processes call response, remembers session ID, Catalog-on-Demand job ID and process ID in the session. Returns call status / error description to the caller.

processTrack.php: polls Catalog-on-Demand API (GetBackgroundJobProcessingState call). Returns call status and results / error description to the caller.
